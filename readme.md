I am learning Pull

You need to write the following commands on the terminal screen so that you can run the project locally.

```sh
1. git clone git@github.com:acemilyalcin/sample-node-project.git
2. cd sample-node-project
3. npm install
4. npm start
```

The application is running on [localhost](http://localhost:3000).
